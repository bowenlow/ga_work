    "<h1>Problem Statement</h1>\n",
    "When someone goes on to plan a stay, they tend to use online reviews to base their decision; However, there are usually a range of opinions so how can we tell if a certain review is fake/real or just plain bad luck? Thus the problem statement is to detect fradulent reviews for people are surfing hotel booking sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Data Source</h1>\n",
    "1600 Labelled Records, 800 True, 800 Fradulent reviews, plain text review (some generated by MTurk) <br>\n",
    "512k Unlabelled Records, with numerical Ratings, Positive and Negative labels\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Prior Research</h1>\n",
    "Using Bi-grams (2-word combinations), detection rate is at ~80% \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Proposed Method(s)</h1>\n",
    "-Preprocess the data as according to the best practices (mentioned in Empath, Stanford, 2016) <br>\n",
    "-train_test_split(train, test)We only train our model from the trainsplit corpus. <br> \n",
    "-Decide on which Vocabulary to use (Unlabelled, or with labelled data)[Unlabelled] <br>\n",

    "-Create additional Text Features: <strike>TF-IDF</strike>, <i>unigram and bigram stopword removal (minor improvement)</i>, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (but tends to be bad with paras with many sentences), <strike>LIWC (Linguistic tagging-word count features)</strike>Can we replicate the individual features?, GloVE, Consistency,<i> Sentiment-Detection (decent results)</i>, <i>LDA, topic-modelling (marginal improvement)</i>, <i>Empath topic modelling </i><br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "-Currently, use of other features such as social network topology, or timestamps, or rating behavior will not be examined. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Risks and Assumptions</h1>\n",
    "Risks: There are quite many NLP libraries available (NLTK, gensim, etc.) which means we have to try substanial number of libraries to assess their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each run of the algorithm takes up a significant amount of time, thus more time is needed so a CUDA-specific libray (TensorFlow) could be used.However this would mean even more time spent on on-boarding. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a assumption that there actually exists some pattern or trend that exists in both truthful and fake reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Specific Aim</h1>\n",
    "To aim to obtain between 71% ~ 74% accuracy overall, with a good f1 score: As it is not very useful to customers if there are a lot of false positive, the noise to signal ratio would overwhelm customers who would then fail to accept the system's recommendation of fake review."
